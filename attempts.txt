Attempt 1:
    ResNet-18, with default architecture. Making no changes and using standard SGD.
    The purpose of this is to have some sort of a baseline to check against

    Result:
        Can't use this, too many parameters.

Attempt 2:
    ResNet-18_mod with [1, 1, 1, 1]
    TrainingAccuracy: ~88
    TestingAccuracy: ~85 

Attempt 3:
    ResNet-18_mod with [2, 1, 1, 1] + adding extra linear layer
    TrainingAccuracy: ~86
    TestingAccuracy: ~83
    Epochs: 15

Attempt 4:
    ResNet-18_mod with [2, 1, 1, 1] + adding two extra linear layers
    TrainingAccuracy: ~86
    TestingAccuracy: ~81
    Epochs: 15

Attempt 5:
    ResNet-18_mod with [2, 1, 1, 1] + adding two extra linear layers
    TrainingAccuracy: ~88
    TestingAccuracy: ~84
    Epochs: 25
